    "# \ud83d\udcc4 Paper Summary 01 \u2014 GPT-1 (2018)\n## Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Authors** | Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, Ilya Sutskever |\n| **Institution** | OpenAI |\n| **Year** | 2018 |\n| **Paper PDF** | [papers/01_gpt_series/GPT1_Language_Understanding_2018.pdf](../papers/01_gpt_series/GPT1_Language_Understanding_2018.pdf) |\n| **Official PDF** | https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf One-Line Summary\n> GPT-1 proved that pre-training a Transformer on unlabelled text, then fine-tuning on a specific task, beats training from scratch on that task alone.\n\n---\n\n## \u2753 Problem It Solves\nBefore GPT-1, most NLP models were **task-specific** \u2014 you trained a separate model for sentiment analysis, another for question answering, another for text classification.\n\nEach model needed thousands of labelled examples for its task.  \nLabelled data is **expensive** to collect.\n\n**The question GPT-1 asked:**  \n*Can a model learn useful language knowledge from cheap unlabelled text, then quickly adapt to specific tasks with far less labelled data?*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 How It Works \u2014 Two Stages\n\n### Stage 1: Unsupervised Pre-Training\n- Feed the model ~800 million words of books (BooksCorpus \u2014 7,000 books)\n- Train it to predict the **next word** given all previous words\n- No labels needed \u2014 the text itself is the supervision\n- Architecture: **12-layer Transformer decoder**, 117M parameters\n\n### Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning\n- Take the pre-trained model\n- Add a task-specific linear layer on top\n- Fine-tune on the (small) labelled dataset\n- The model \"transfers\" knowledge from pre-training\n\n```\nBooksCorpus (7B words)\n       \u2193  unsupervised pre-training\nTransformer Decoder (12 layers, 117M params)\n       \u2193  add linear head + fine-tune on labelled data\nTask-specific model (classification / QA / entailment / etc.)\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Key Results\n- Improved state-of-the-art on **9 out of 12** NLP benchmark tasks\n- Needed **far fewer labelled examples** per task than previous approaches\n- Showed that one pre-trained model \u2192 many tasks (the birth of \"foundation models\")\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Key Insights\n1. **Scale unlabelled data beats task-specific labelled data.** Reading 7 billion words of books teaches the model more than any labelled dataset.\n2. **Transfer learning works in NLP** \u2014 just as it had been working in computer vision with ImageNet pre-training.\n3. **The Transformer decoder is a natural language modeller** \u2014 its causal (left-to-right) attention is exactly what you need for next-word prediction.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd Where It Fits in the GPT Story\n\n```\nGPT-1 (2018)  \u2192  Proved pre-train + fine-tune works\nGPT-2 (2019)  \u2192  What if we skip fine-tuning entirely?\nGPT-3 (2020)  \u2192  What if we scale to 175B params?\nInstructGPT   \u2192  What if we align it with human values?\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Read This Paper\n\n| Section | What to focus on | Estimated time |\n|---|---|---|\n| Abstract | The core claim | 3 min |\n| Section 3.1 \u2014 Unsupervised pre-training | The language modelling objective | 10 min |\n| Section 3.2 \u2014 Supervised fine-tuning | How task heads are attached | 10 min |\n| Section 4 \u2014 Experiments | The 9/12 benchmark results | 10 min |\n| Figure 1 | The two-stage diagram | 2 min |\n\n**Skip on first read:** Appendix, ablation studies in Section 5.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Further Reading\n- GPT-2 paper \u2014 what happens when you scale and remove fine-tuning\n- BERT paper \u2014 what happens when you make it bidirectional instead\n- \"The Illustrated GPT-2\" by Jay Alammar \u2014 best visual explanation\n"
